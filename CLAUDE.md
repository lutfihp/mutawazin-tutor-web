# Mutawazin — Project Context for Claude Code

## What This Project Is

Mutawazin (Arabic for "balanced") is an online tutoring platform frontend built in SvelteKit. It connects teachers and students for group courses and 1-on-1 sessions.

**Working directory:** `d:\Codading Repo\mutawazin-tutor-web`
**SvelteKit app is at the repo root** — `src/`, `package.json`, etc. live directly in `d:\Codading Repo\mutawazin-tutor-web`
**Backend:** FastAPI at `http://localhost:8000` — not in this repo
**Design handoffs:** `handoffs/` — local only (gitignored). Contains: `design_handoff_mutawazin/`, `brand_kit_handoff/`, FE handoff MDs.

---

## Working with the Backend

**Backend repo:** `d:\Codading Repo\mutawazin-tutor-api` — FastAPI, separate Claude Code session.

**Rule: Never edit backend files directly from this session.** If something doesn't work and the cause appears to be in the backend:
1. Stop immediately — do not attempt to debug or fix the backend
2. Tell the user: *"This looks like a backend issue. Here's a prompt to paste into the backend Claude Code session:"*
3. Write a short, factual prompt describing only: **what was called**, **what happened**, and **what was expected** — no root cause analysis, no suggested fix. The backend session has full context to debug and fix it.
4. Wait for the user to confirm the backend is fixed before continuing on the frontend

### Build status: ✅ Passes `npm run check` (0 errors, 16 pre-existing warnings)

### GitHub remote: ✅ `https://github.com/lutfihp/mutawazin-tutor-web` — branch `main` pushed (sessions 12–15 commits local only, not yet pushed)

### Login flow: ✅ Confirmed working end-to-end with `admin@mutawazin.com` / `changeme123`

### What is complete

| Area | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Foundation | SvelteKit scaffold, Tailwind v3, svelte-i18n, ui components, layouts, auth | ✅ |
| Auth | Login, Register (teacher/student) + **debounced email availability check**, Email Verify, Account Step-Up, Forgot Password, Reset Password | ✅ |
| Landing | Hero (brand mark), Benefits, Public search (courses+teachers tabs), Featured Teachers, Footer | ✅ |
| Admin | Overview (stats + pending approvals), `/admin/teachers` (**three-dot menu**, **featured confirm modal**, delete, create + username check), `/admin/students` (**three-dot menu**, **age from DOB**, delete, create + username check), `/admin/subjects` (**three-dot menu**, **edit modal**, delete, create) | ✅ |
| Admin Courses | `/admin/courses` — list all courses, **create** (teacher + subject pickers, age categories + price per category, description), **edit** (subject locked if enrolled, teacher change warning, status toggle), **delete** (409 handling). Sidebar link added. | ✅ |
| Admin Calendar | `/admin/calendar` — month grid via `GET /calendar/admin`, **teacher picker filter**, session edit modal (`PUT /sessions/:id`), session create (teacher_id required), recurring templates panel (when teacher filtered, full CRUD). Delta v6 + v7. | ✅ |
| Delta v5 backend | Admin course CRUD via `POST/PUT/DELETE /admin/courses/:id` | ✅ |
| Delta v6 backend | `GET /calendar/admin`, `PUT /sessions/:id` (edit any session), `POST /sessions` teacher_id required for admin | ✅ |
| Delta v7 backend | All `/sessions/recurring` endpoints accept `teacher_id` for admin | ✅ |
| Dashboards | Teacher dashboard (real names + My Students roster), Student dashboard, Admin → `/admin` redirect | ✅ |
| Profiles | Teacher profile (**redesigned** — per-section pencil editing, Card header + chips row, **handoff SVG icons** for credential sections, **SVG star** replacing ★ Unicode), Student profile (**age badge from DOB**) | ✅ |
| Teacher profile chips row | Chips row uses **inline SVGs** (globe for mode, map-pin for city). Offline mode → globe `opacity-50`. **Teaching methods badges removed** (not in handoff). Mode + city are **editable inline** via `PUT /teachers/me` following the per-section pencil pattern. | ✅ |
| Error pages | `static/errors/502.html`, `503.html`, `504.html` translated to **Bahasa Indonesia**. `src/lib/components/ErrorState.svelte` — Svelte 5 snippet-based presentational component (tone variants: blue/teal/amber/rose/slate). `src/routes/+error.svelte` — full handoff implementation: 401/403/404/429/500 + fallback, each with correct icon, copy, and actions. | ✅ |
| Courses | Filter + grid, create via subject picker, suggest new subject, admin+teacher can create, admin Enroll Student | ✅ |
| Calendar | Month grid, session pills + recurring badge, availability panel, Recurring templates, Add Session, Availability CRUD | ✅ |
| Reports | Score grid, create/edit modal, Share button + panel, public `/report/share/:token` page | ✅ |
| Brand | **Updated brand mark** — `Logo.svelte` now uses the real Mutawazin SVG mark; `static/brand-kit/png/logo-mark-*.png` updated from handoff (optimized, ~50% smaller) | ✅ |
| Subjects | Renamed from "Catalog"; 5-level age categories | ✅ |
| Navigation | Logout button, Sidebar profile/reports hrefs wired via `userId` prop chain | ✅ |
| `/teachers` public page | Featured teachers grid, footer + landing "Browse all" links | ✅ |
| Delta v4 backend | Email/username availability checks, Delete teacher/student/subject with confirmation modals, `"deleted"` status filtering | ✅ |
| Delta v8 backend | `GET /admin/stats` now returns `active_courses` (count of courses with status === "active"). Frontend already reads `s.active_courses ?? 0` — no frontend change needed. | ✅ |
| Navbar avatar | Admin: no avatar. Teacher/Student: `onMount` fetches own profile (`GET /teachers/:id` or `GET /students/:id`), renders Avatar as link to their profile page. Uses `full_name` + `photo_url` — falls back to blank colored circle if fetch fails. | ✅ |
| Course detail page | `src/routes/courses/[id]/` — server load fetches `GET /courses/:id` (throws 404 if not found). Page shows: name + status badges, description, teacher link, pricing grid by age category. Role-conditional: student sees "Enrolled" badge if enrolled; teacher/admin sees enrolled count; admin sees "Manage enrollments →" link to `/admin/courses`. No self-enrollment (admin-only). | ✅ |
| Delta v9 attendance removal | `attendance` field removed from all frontend: report list page (state, filter dropdown, modal radio, payload, $effect tracking), student profile recent reports section, public share page, and dashboard latest report hardcoded badge. Dead i18n keys removed from `en.json` and `id.json` (`attendanceFilter`, `modal.attendance/*Option`, `status.present/late/absent`). | ✅ |
| Bug fixes (session 12) | Course detail shows `teacher_name` as primary text. Report page + share page use correct `sc.max_score` field (not `sc.max`). Report page + share page use `formatDate(report.created_at)` (not `report.date`). Dead "View Full" button removed from reports footer (teacher-only now). | ✅ |
| UI polish (session 12) | Attendance badge deleted from report list entirely (not just hidden). Student age badge uses translatable i18n key `profile.student.yearsOld` (`{age} years old` / `{age} tahun`). Teacher profile course cards use `text-text2` for age categories (was `text-text3`, too light). | ✅ |
| Student DOB edit | Student profile (`students/[id]/+page.svelte`) — DOB edit UI added: pencil button → date input → save via `PUT /students/me { date_of_birth }`. Age badge reads `profile.age` (not formula), gated to `isOwn \|\| admin`. Waiting on backend to return `age: int \| null` from `GET /students/:id` before values are non-null. | ✅ (UI done, wired up; live when backend ships delta v9) |
| i18n fixes (session 13) | Added `common.age` key (EN: "Age", ID: "Usia") to both locale files. Admin students Age column header now uses `$t('common.age')` instead of hardcoded "Age". Admin calendar teacher filter fixed: `aria-label` uses correct path `dashboard.admin.filterByTeacher`; default option uses `courses.allTeachers` ("All teachers" / "Semua guru") instead of raw key. | ✅ |
| CI/CD pipeline (session 14) | `adapter-auto` → `adapter-node` (required for Docker). `Dockerfile` (node:22-alpine, non-root `app` user, port 3000). `docker-compose.yml` (port 3000, `env_file: .env`, restart: unless-stopped). `.github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled` — GitHub Actions: npm build in CI → rsync artifact to VPS → `docker compose up --build -d`. `docs/deployment-guide.md` — full 9-step VPS setup guide. **Workflow is disabled** pending VPS setup + GitHub secrets. | ✅ (code done; first deploy pending) |
| Delta v11 pagination (session 15) | All list API responses migrated from plain arrays to `PaginatedResponse<T>`. Added `PaginationMeta` + `PaginatedResponse<T>` types to `api.ts`. New `<Pagination />` component (`src/lib/components/ui/Pagination.svelte`) — hidden when `totalPages <= 1`. **Category A (pagination UI):** admin/teachers (pageSize 25), admin/students (25), admin/subjects (25), courses (12), reports (20). **Category B (unwrap only):** admin/courses (3 sub-calls), admin/calendar (3 sub-calls + recurring), calendar (3 sub-calls), dashboard (students), register/teacher (subjects). Server-side `+page.server.ts` files fixed: `.then((b: any) => b.data ?? [])` on all list fetches. Audit log breaking changes fixed (was using deleted `AuditLogListResponse` type). | ✅ |
| Audit log UI polish (session 15) | `src/routes/admin/settings/audit-log/+page.svelte`: Actor column — role pill badge replaced with 8×8px colored dot (`bg-violet-600` admin, `bg-teal-600` teacher, `bg-amber-500` student, `bg-border` fallback) + `title` tooltip. Resource column — shows `resource_type` only, UUID fragment removed. Legend added between filter card and table card: "Actor role: ● Admin ● Teacher ● Student". `truncateId` kept (still used in diff panel expanded row). | ✅ |
| Filter flicker fix (session 16) | **admin/teachers, admin/students, audit-log:** Changed loading guard from `{#if loading}` (replaces table with skeleton on every filter change) to `{#if loading && list.length === 0}` (skeleton only on first load). Added `class:opacity-50={loading} class:pointer-events-none={loading}` on the table wrapper so subsequent loads dim the existing rows instead of replacing them. Pattern: show skeletons when the list is genuinely empty; overlay when refreshing. | ✅ |
| Courses SSR initial load (session 16) | `src/routes/courses/+page.server.ts` now fetches `GET /courses?page=1&limit=12` server-side and returns `{ courses, totalPages }`. `+page.svelte` initializes `courses` and `totalPages` from `data` (SSR props), sets `loading = false` initially, removes the `onMount` call to `fetchCourses()`, and removes the `$effect` that watched filters (replaced with explicit `onchange` handlers on each filter `<select>`). Result: courses page renders with data on first load — no loading spinner on initial visit. Subsequent filter/page changes still use CSR fetch with opacity overlay. | ✅ |
| Deployment guide update (session 16) | `docs/deployment-guide.md` updated to match actual VPS state from backend deployment: references `mutawazin` non-root user (not `root`), deploy directory is `/home/mutawazin/mutawazin-web` (not `/root/mutawazin-web`), reuses existing `github_deploy` SSH keypair (already on VPS from backend CI setup) instead of generating a new key. | ✅ |
| Delta v12 — dashboard report titles (session 17) | `GET /dashboard/teacher` now returns `subject_name: string\|null`, `student_name: string\|null`, `session_date: string\|null` on each `recent_reports` item. Added `DashboardReportItem` type to `src/lib/api.ts`. Dashboard report cards now show `"{subject_name} — {student_name}"` + `formatDate(session_date ?? created_at)` instead of raw IDs. | ✅ |
| Write Report flow — `/reports/new` (session 17) | New dedicated page replacing broken "Write Report" quick action (was `href=/dashboard#private-students`, now `/reports/new`). Three-step state machine on one URL: (1) session list — `GET /calendar/me` last 30 days, filtered to `starts_at <= now`, sorted newest first; (2) student picker — private session uses `session.student_id`, group session fetches `GET /courses/:course_id` → `enrolled_student_ids`; (3) report form — scores, notes, understanding level A–E, submits to `POST /sessions/:id/reports`. Auth guard: teacher-only. Layout: `src/routes/reports/new/+layout.svelte` (own AuthLayout wrapper, separate from `[studentId]` layout). | ✅ |
| API gap analysis (session 18) | Read full `api-types.ts` contract, compared against all frontend API calls. Key finding: approve/reject for teachers/students IS implemented on `/admin` overview page (not `/admin/teachers`). Documented 5 remaining gaps in `docs/api-gap-analysis.md`: `POST /auth/resend-verification`, `PUT /teachers/me/credentials`, `PUT /courses/{id}` (teacher non-admin edit), plus 3 unconsumed read endpoints (`GET /sessions/{id}`, `GET /sessions/{id}/rating`, `GET /reports/{id}`). | ✅ |
| Reports page UI polish (session 18) | `src/routes/reports/[studentId]/+page.svelte` — card title now shows `subject_name — teacher_name` (e.g. "Matematika — Ahmad Fauzi") instead of `session_title`. Removed `avgScore()` function and average score text from subtitle — subtitle is date only. Score tiles show raw score number only — no `/ max_score`, no progress bar (max score varies per topic, making comparison misleading). Scores section already conditionally hidden when `scores: []`. | ✅ |
| Favicon (session 18) | Added `<link rel="icon">` tags to `src/app.html` — SVG primary (`/brand-kit/svg/favicon.svg`) + PNG fallbacks (32×32, 16×16) from existing brand kit. No files copied — links point to existing `static/brand-kit/` assets. | ✅ |
| Default language ID (session 18) | Changed `DEFAULT_LANG` from `'en'` to `'id'` in `src/lib/i18n.ts`. Bahasa Indonesia is now the default for new visitors. Users with a stored `lang` preference in localStorage/cookie are unaffected. | ✅ |
| Teacher registration — phone replaces credentials (session 20) | `src/routes/register/teacher/+page.svelte` — credentials collapsible removed entirely; phone number `<input type="tel">` added after Bio. Label uses `profile.phoneNumber` i18n key (no "(optional)" text). Submit payload: `phone_number: phoneNumber \|\| null`. 7 credential i18n keys removed from `en.json` + `id.json`. 3 commits pushed to `origin/main`. Backend delta v14 needed: add `phone_number: str \| None = None` to `TeacherRegisterRequest`. | ✅ (frontend done; backend delta v14 pending) |
| Delta v13 — phone number (session 19) | Optional private `phone_number: string\|null` field added to teacher and student profiles. **Teacher profile:** new Phone Number card after Achievements (same per-section pencil pattern — `editingPhoneNumber`/`savingPhoneNumber`/`savePhoneNumber()`/`openSection('phoneNumber')`). Visible to `isOwn \|\| isAdmin`. Added `isAdmin = $derived(data.user?.role === 'admin')` to teacher profile. **Student profile:** inline phone row after DOB (same inline-edit pattern as DOB). Owner always sees field + pencil; admin sees field only when non-null; teacher callers see nothing (API returns null). Cross-cancel with DOB edit. **Types:** `TeacherProfileResponse`, `UpdateTeacherProfileRequest`, `StudentProfileResponse`, `UpdateStudentProfileRequest` added to `src/lib/api.ts`. **i18n:** `profile.phoneNumber` + `profile.phoneNumberPlaceholder` added to `en.json` + `id.json`. 4 commits on `main`, not yet pushed. | ✅ (code done; live verify pending) |

### What is NOT done yet (known gaps)

1. **Admin Courses — student enrollment management** — enroll/unenroll students per course (`POST /courses/:id/enroll`, `DELETE /courses/:id/enroll/:student_id`). Deferred to follow-up; the page exists but has no student management UI yet.

2. **Runtime verification** — admin calendar, session edit, teacher profile redesign, navbar avatar fetch, course detail page, and all previous delta features not yet tested against live backend.

3. **Availability slot `id` field** — not yet tested live. If edit/delete fail, fix `{@const slotId = slot.id ?? slot.slot_id ?? ''}` in `src/routes/calendar/+page.svelte`.

4. **Mobile testing** — hamburger sidebar untested at 375px viewport.

5. **Teacher profile — live verify** — redesign + chips row edit not yet tested against live backend. Confirm `GET /teachers/:user_id` returns `courses[]` with `name`, `age_categories`, `description`, and that `PUT /teachers/me` accepts per-section payloads (bio, university, experience, achievements, teaching_mode, city).

6. **Admin calendar — recurring student picker** — the recurring modal for private sessions uses a plain text input for student ID (not a dropdown). When backend student list is confirmed available, replace with a `<select>` from `adminStudents`.

7. **Course detail page — live verify** — not yet tested against live backend. Confirm `GET /courses/:id` returns the expected shape (especially `enrolled_student_ids[]` and `price_by_age_category`). Verify the 404 error page renders correctly for unknown course IDs.

8. **Teacher profile stats — verify live (delta v9 shipped)** — Backend now returns `years_experience` and `sessions_completed`. Frontend at `src/routes/teachers/[id]/+page.svelte` already reads `profile.years_experience ?? 0` and `profile.sessions_completed ?? 0`. Just verify the numbers show correctly in production.

9. **Admin students age column — one-line fix needed (delta v9 shipped)** — Backend now returns `age: int | null` on `GET /admin/students`. Replace the IIFE formula at `admin/students/+page.svelte` Age column with `user.age != null ? String(user.age) : '—'`. Student profile DOB edit is already wired up — just verify live.

10. **Courses SSR — verify `access_token` cookie forwarding** — `+page.server.ts` manually forwards the `access_token` cookie header to the API. Live-verify that the SSR fetch actually returns data (not 401). If the backend requires a Bearer token instead of cookie, change header to `Authorization: Bearer ${token}`. Also verify filter changes after SSR load still work (CSR refetch path).

11. **Delta v13 phone number — live verify** — Log in as teacher (own profile): Phone Number card appears, pencil opens `<input type="tel">`, save calls `PUT /teachers/me { phone_number }`, value persists. Log in as admin: card visible on any teacher/student profile with no pencil. Log in as another teacher: card NOT visible on peer profiles. Log in as student (own profile): phone row appears, pencil opens inline edit, DOB edit closes phone and vice versa. Push the 4 delta v13 commits to GitHub remote: `git push origin main`.

## Architecture Decisions (already made — don't change these)

| Decision | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Svelte 5 runes mode** | Enforced by `svelte.config.js`. Use `$props()`, `$state()`, `$derived()`, `$effect()`, `{@render children()}`. No `export let`, no `<slot>`. |
| **svelte-i18n** | Cookie-based lang (no URL prefix changes). `$t('key')` everywhere. EN/ID toggle in Navbar. |
| **Tailwind v3** (not v4) | v4 was installed by default and downgraded. Config is in `tailwind.config.js`. |
| **Sub-layouts per route group** | Each authenticated route group has its own `+layout.svelte` wrapping `<AuthLayout>`. |
| **CSR for feature pages** | Courses/Calendar/Reports load data in `onMount`, not SSR. Auth guard in `+page.server.ts` only. |
| **focusTrap action** | `src/lib/actions/focusTrap.ts` — shared by Modal and mobile Sidebar. |
| **Static gradient lookup** | Course band variants use a 6-element `BAND_VARIANTS` array with full static Tailwind arbitrary-value strings. Tailwind purge requires static strings. |
| **hooks.server.ts populates locals.user** | Auth context lives in `src/hooks.server.ts`. All `+page.server.ts` guards check `locals.user` set by the hook — NOT by `+layout.server.ts`. Do not remove the hook or move this logic. |
| **adapter-node (not adapter-auto)** | Switched from `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` to `@sveltejs/adapter-node` for Docker deployment. Build output lands in `build/`, entry point is `build/index.js`, default port 3000. VPS `.env` must contain `ORIGIN=https://mutawazinprivate.com` for CSRF protection. |
| **Subjects = name only** | `Subject` model has only `{ id, name, status }` — no subject field or age_categories. Age categories live on `Course` directly. `/catalog` endpoints renamed to `/subjects`. |
| **5-level age categories** | Values: `"pre-school"`, `"elementary"`, `"middle-school"`, `"high-school"`, `"general"`. Old `"kids"/"teens"/"adults"` are gone. |
| **pendingApprovalCount store** | `src/lib/stores/adminBadge.ts` — currently unused after admin restructure (sidebar badge removed). Store still exists but is no longer written to. |
| **Admin sub-layouts are pass-through** | `/admin/teachers`, `/admin/students`, `/admin/subjects` each have `+layout.svelte` files that are simple `{@render children()}` pass-throughs — no `<AuthLayout>` wrapper. The parent `/admin/+layout.svelte` already provides `<AuthLayout>`. Adding `<AuthLayout>` in a child layout causes double-wrapping (two sidebars, double `ml-60` offset). |
| **Sidebar userId prop chain** | `userId` flows: sub-layout `data.user?.id` → `<AuthLayout userId>` → `<Sidebar userId>`. Required for My Profile and My Reports hrefs. All authenticated sub-layouts pass it. |
| **AuthLayout content centering** | `<main>` has `flex-1 sidebar-collapse:ml-60 p-6 lg:p-8`. The `max-w-app mx-auto` is on an inner `<div>` wrapping `{@render children()}`, NOT on `<main>` itself. This centers content within the post-sidebar space on wide viewports. Do not move `max-w-app mx-auto` back to `<main>`. |
| **DropdownMenu component** | `src/lib/components/ui/DropdownMenu.svelte` — shared three-dot action dropdown. Props: `items: { label, onclick, variant? }[]`. Handles open/close via `onfocusout` on a `tabindex="-1"` wrapper and Escape key. Used on all three admin table pages. |
| **Admin action pattern** | All admin table rows use `<DropdownMenu>` for actions (View Profile, Delete, Feature/Edit). Delete and Featured actions open confirmation modals before executing. All modals use the existing `<Modal>` component with inline state per page. |
| **Age from DOB pattern** | **Replaced by backend-computed `age: int` field.** `students/[id]/+page.svelte` already reads `profile.age` directly (formula removed). Formula still in `admin/students/+page.svelte` — replace with `user.age != null ? String(user.age) : '—'` once backend ships delta v9 (`age` field on admin students list). |
| **DropdownMenu fixed positioning** | `DropdownMenu.svelte` panel uses `position: fixed` with `getBoundingClientRect()` on the trigger button to compute `top` and `right`. This escapes `overflow-x-auto` table containers — do NOT revert to `absolute`. |
| **Admin table header alignment** | All `<th>` in admin tables use `text-left`, including the Actions column. The `<td>` for the actions column keeps `text-right` so the `⋮` button stays right-aligned, but the header label is left-aligned. |
| **Admin courses page pattern** | `/admin/courses` loads courses + teachers + subjects in parallel on mount. `teacherMap` (teacher_id → full_name) is built from the teacher list for display. Price per age category is stored as `Record<string, string>` in state (for input binding) and converted to `Record<string, number>` on submit. |
| **Teacher profile per-section edit pattern** | `src/routes/teachers/[id]/+page.svelte` has one `editing*` / `saving*` / save-function triple per editable section (bio, university, experience, achievements). `openSection(name)` sets the named section to `true` and all others to `false` — enforces mutual exclusion so only one section is editable at a time. Camera overlay on avatar is always shown to `isOwn` (no editMode toggle). |
| **Teacher profile data display** | API data is adapted to the design: `university: string` shown as a single name row; `teaching_experience: [{subject, year_from, year_to}]` shown as subject + year range; `achievements: string[]` shown as plain string rows. Sections are hidden on public view when empty; on own view they show "Not set" with a pencil button. `teaching_mode` and `city` shown as SVG-icon chips below a `<hr>` in the profile header card. **`teaching_methods[]` chips are removed** — not in the current handoff. |
| **Teacher profile chips row** | Globe SVG = teaching_mode (online/offline/both). Offline-only → globe gets `opacity-50` class. Map-pin SVG = city. Both chips use `stroke="currentColor"` inline SVG. When `isOwn`, a pencil button opens inline edit: `<select>` for mode + `<input>` for city, saves via `PUT /teachers/me`. Follows the same `editingTeachingInfo` / `savingTeachingInfo` / `openSection('teachingInfo')` pattern as other sections. |
| **ErrorState component** | `src/lib/components/ErrorState.svelte` — Svelte 5 `$props()` with snippet props: `icon?`, `actions?`, `extra?`. Props: `tone` (blue/teal/amber/rose/slate), `code`, `title`, `body`, `noTile`. Used exclusively by `src/routes/+error.svelte`. Static nginx error pages (`static/errors/502.html`, `503.html`, `504.html`) are pure HTML/CSS/inline SVG — no JS, no external fonts, text in Bahasa Indonesia. |
| **Admin calendar pattern** | `src/routes/admin/calendar/+page.svelte` — CSR, loads in `onMount`. Fetches sessions via `GET /calendar/admin?from=&to=&teacher_id=`. Teacher list from `GET /admin/teachers` (use `teacher.user_id ?? teacher.id` as ID). Courses from `GET /courses`. Students from `GET /admin/students`. Session edit uses `PUT /sessions/:id`. Session create requires `teacher_id` in body. Recurring endpoints now accept `teacher_id` query (GET) and body field (POST) per delta v7. |
| **Admin calendar teacher ID field** | Teachers from `GET /admin/teachers` expose both `user_id` and `id` — always use `teacher.user_id ?? teacher.id` as the key (same as admin/courses page). The `teacher_id` on sessions matches this value. |
| **Session edit (admin)** | `PUT /sessions/:id` — admin can edit title, starts_at, ends_at, mode, price, teacher_id, student_id, course_id. Teacher role can only edit title/time/mode/price (teacher_id/student_id/course_id ignored). Endpoint added in delta v6. |
| **Navbar profile fetch pattern** | `Navbar.svelte` fetches the logged-in user's own profile on `onMount` (teacher → `GET /teachers/:id`, student → `GET /students/:id`). Stores `profileName` + `profileSrc` in local `$state`. Admin gets no avatar. Teacher/student Avatar is wrapped in `<a>` linking to their profile page. No changes to `hooks.server.ts`, `app.d.ts`, or the `User` store type — JWT only carries `{ id, role, status }`. |
| **Course detail page pattern** | `src/routes/courses/[id]/+page.server.ts` — SSR load: auth guard + `GET /courses/:id` + `throw error(404)` if not found, returns `{ course, user: locals.user }`. Parent `src/routes/courses/+layout.svelte` provides `<AuthLayout>` — no new layout needed. Page uses `AGE_KEYS` map to translate API age-category strings to existing `courses.age*` i18n keys. Price formatted with `Intl.NumberFormat('id-ID', { currency: 'IDR' })`. Student self-enrollment is NOT allowed — enrollment is admin-only via `/admin/courses`. |
| **PaginatedResponse pattern** | All list endpoints return `{ data: T[]; pagination: { page, pageSize, totalItems, totalPages } }`. Types `PaginationMeta` and `PaginatedResponse<T>` are in `src/lib/api.ts`. CSR pages: `api.get<PaginatedResponse<T>>(url)` → destructure `data` + `pagination`. Server-side `+page.server.ts` uses native `fetch` → chain `.then((b: any) => b.data ?? [])` to unwrap. Never use the old plain-array shape. |
| **Pagination component** | `src/lib/components/ui/Pagination.svelte` — props: `page: number`, `totalPages: number`, `onPage: (n: number) => void`. Renders nothing when `totalPages <= 1`. Placed inside the table `<Card>` after the `<table>`, before `</Card>`. Caller manages `page` state and passes a `changePage(n)` handler that sets `page = n` and refetches. Category A pages (primary list content) get the full UI. Category B pages (sub-calls for pickers/dropdowns) just unwrap `.data` — no pagination UI needed. |
| **Server-side filter pattern (paginated)** | Admin pages with status filters (teachers, students) pass the filter as a query param to the API (`?status=active`) instead of doing client-side array filtering. `onchange` on the select resets `page = 1` then calls the fetch function. The old `filteredTeachers` / `filteredStudents` `$derived` values were removed — they are incompatible with server-side pagination. |
| **Flicker-free loading pattern** | All list pages use a two-state loading display: (1) `{#if loading && list.length === 0}` → show skeleton rows or spinner only on first/empty load; (2) `class:opacity-50={loading} class:pointer-events-none={loading}` on the table/grid wrapper → dim existing content during filter/page refreshes. Never unconditionally replace the table with a skeleton on every fetch — that causes visible flicker. Applied to: admin/teachers, admin/students, audit-log, courses. |
| **Courses SSR initial load pattern** | `src/routes/courses/+page.server.ts` fetches the first page SSR and returns `{ courses, totalPages }`. `+page.svelte` initializes state from `data` (no `onMount` fetch). Filter `<select>` elements use explicit `onchange` handlers (`() => { page = 1; scheduleRefetch(); }`) instead of a reactive `$effect` watching filter vars — `$effect` caused double-fetches on mount. Never use `$effect` to trigger side-effects on filter state changes. |
| **`/reports/new` page pattern** | `src/routes/reports/new/` — teacher-only write-report flow. Has its own `+layout.svelte` (AuthLayout wrapper) because the parent `reports/[studentId]/+layout.svelte` is scoped to that route only. Three-step state machine: `step: 'sessions' \| 'students' \| 'form'`. On mount fetches `GET /calendar/me?from=<30d ago>&to=<today>` + `GET /students` in parallel. Session filter: `starts_at <= now` (not `status === 'completed'` — teacher may finish early). Student resolution: private sessions use `session.student_id` directly; group sessions fetch `GET /courses/:course_id` → `enrolled_student_ids[]` resolved against `studentMap`. Submit: `POST /sessions/:id/reports { student_id, scores, notes, understanding_level? }`. Success shows inline banner + "Write another" resets to step 1. |

- **Delta v9 (✅ backend shipped):**
  - `GET /teachers/:user_id` now returns `years_experience: int` and `sessions_completed: int`
  - `GET /admin/students` now returns `age: int | null` per student
  - `GET /students/:id` now returns `age: int | null`, keeps `date_of_birth`
  - **Frontend action needed:** Admin students Age column still uses IIFE formula — replace with `user.age != null ? String(user.age) : '—'` at `admin/students/+page.svelte`. All other frontend is already wired up.

## Design Reference

All visual specs are in `handoffs/design_handoff_mutawazin/` (local only, gitignored):
- `original-handoff.md` / `README.md` — design tokens, component specs
- HTML stage files — open in browser to see intended output

**Design tokens are in `tailwind.config.js`** — always use Tailwind classes, never inline hex values.

---

## How to Run

```powershell
cd "d:\Codading Repo\mutawazin-tutor-web"
npm run dev           # dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run check         # TypeScript + Svelte type check (0 errors)
npm run build         # production build
npm run preview       # preview prod build at http://localhost:4173
```

The FastAPI backend must be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

**Test credentials:** `admin@mutawazin.com` / `changeme123` → lands on `/admin`

## What to Do Next Session

**Priority 1 — Backend delta v14 + live verify teacher registration phone number**
1. Paste the backend prompt from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-07-teacher-register-phone-replace-credentials.md` (Task 3) into the backend Claude Code session — adds `phone_number: str | None = None` to `TeacherRegisterRequest`
2. Open `/register/teacher`: credentials accordion is gone, phone number field appears between Bio and Subjects, no "(optional)" label
3. Register with a phone number → account created, teacher profile shows the phone number
4. Register leaving phone number blank → registration succeeds, phone number is null on the record

**Priority 2 — Live verify delta v13 profile phone numbers**
1. Log in as **teacher** (own profile `/teachers/:id`): Phone Number card appears after Achievements, pencil opens tel input, save persists value
2. Log in as **admin**: Phone Number card visible on teacher + student profiles (no pencil), shows value or "Belum diisi"
3. Log in as **another teacher**: view a peer's teacher profile → Phone Number card NOT visible
4. Log in as **student** (own profile): phone row appears below DOB, pencil opens inline edit, opening DOB closes phone and vice versa
5. Log in as **admin**, view student with no phone set → phone row hidden (only shows when non-null)

**Priority 3 — Live verify `/reports/new` + reports page changes (sessions 17–18)**
1. Log in as teacher → `/dashboard` → "Write Report" → confirm navigates to `/reports/new`
2. Session list: confirm past sessions appear sorted newest first; future sessions NOT shown
3. Click a private session → one student shown; group session → enrolled students shown
4. Click a student → report form → fill + submit → success banner → "Write another" resets to step 1
5. Back arrow: form → students → sessions
6. Open a student's report list (`/reports/:studentId`): confirm card titles show "Matematika — Ahmad Fauzi" format, no average score text, score tiles show raw number only (no bar, no / max)
7. Log in as student/admin → visit `/reports/new` → confirm redirect to `/dashboard`

**Priority 4 — First production deploy (VPS setup)**
Follow `docs/deployment-guide.md` step by step (references `mutawazin` user and existing `github_deploy` SSH keypair):
1. SSH in: `ssh mutawazin@YOUR_DROPLET_IP`
2. Create deploy dir: `mkdir -p /home/mutawazin/mutawazin-web && echo "ORIGIN=https://mutawazinprivate.com" > /home/mutawazin/mutawazin-web/.env`
3. Confirm existing SSH key: `ls ~/.ssh/github_deploy.pub` — reuse it (already authorized from backend CI)
4. Print private key and add to **this** GitHub repo's secrets: `cat ~/.ssh/github_deploy`
5. Add 5 GitHub secrets: `SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USER=mutawazin`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `DEPLOY_PATH=/home/mutawazin/mutawazin-web`, `VITE_API_URL=https://api.mutawazinprivate.com`
6. Configure Nginx on VPS to proxy `mutawazinprivate.com` → `localhost:3000` (SSL via Certbot)
7. Enable workflow: `git mv .github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled .github/workflows/deploy.yml && git commit -m "ci: enable deploy workflow" && git push origin main`
8. Watch Actions tab — should complete in ~2-3 min. Verify with `curl -I http://localhost:3000` on VPS.

**Priority 5 — Finish delta v9 (backend now shipped)**
1. **Admin students age column — one-line code fix** — Replace the IIFE formula at `admin/students/+page.svelte` Age column with `user.age != null ? String(user.age) : '—'`.
2. **Teacher profile stats — verify live** — Log in as teacher, open own profile. Confirm "X yrs experience · Y sessions completed" shows real numbers (not 0 · 0).
3. **Student DOB edit — live verify** — Log in as student, open own profile. Age badge shows a number, pencil opens date input, save calls `PUT /students/me { date_of_birth }`.

**Priority 6 — Live verify accumulated features**
1. **Admin dashboard** — `/admin`: "Active Courses" card shows non-zero count; pending teacher/student tables show Approve/Reject buttons; pending subject suggestions show Approve/Reject.
2. **Navbar avatar** — Teacher/student: avatar appears, clicking links to own profile. Admin: no avatar.
3. **Course detail page** — `/courses/:id`: loads without 404, shows teacher name + pricing grid, enrolled badge for students.
4. **Reports page** — teacher view: no attendance filter, card titles are "subject — teacher", score tiles raw number only, date from `created_at`.
5. **Public share page** — `/report/share/:token`: date and scores render correctly, no attendance badge.
6. **Admin calendar** — sessions load, teacher filter works, session edit modal saves via `PUT /sessions/:id`.
7. **Teacher profile** — per-section editing works, SVG icons render, chips row shows mode + city.
8. **Error page smoke test** — `/nonexistent` → 404 page with correct icon and buttons.

**Priority 7 — Known API gaps to implement (see `docs/api-gap-analysis.md`)**
- `POST /auth/resend-verification` — add resend button to `/verify-email` page
- `PUT /teachers/me/credentials` — wire credentials section save in teacher profile
- **Admin Courses — student enrollment management** — enroll/unenroll UI using `POST /courses/:id/enroll` + `DELETE /courses/:id/enroll/:student_id`

**Priority 8 — Runtime QA**
- Test delta v4: email check on register pages, username check on admin create modals, Delete on all three admin table pages
- Test Calendar Add Session end-to-end (`POST /sessions`, session appears on calendar)
- Test Availability CRUD (Add/Edit/Delete slots — verify `slot.id` field)
- Courses SSR: verify `access_token` cookie forwarding works (not 401 on SSR fetch)

**Priority 9 — Mobile + Visual QA**
- Open DevTools at 375px, test hamburger sidebar drawer, verify all pages are usable
